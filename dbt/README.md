## Prerequisites
* Students should have a minimum knowledge of SQL (normally the snowflake/sql training is the day before)
* The student should already have a dbt Cloud or dbt account on their local machine

## Goal
The goal of the training is to show the main lines of the technologies 
and to show what is the transformation part of the ELT present in many works of the data engineers 

## Course of the training
* Quick overview of the technology 
* Hands on :
    - The challenge here is to introduce the technology in a quick but efficient way
    - And transform the data in Snowflake for the next need which is the visualisation with Superset
